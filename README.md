# Example project
An example project for the backend class to play around and teaching basic usage of external APIs =) 

## How to build:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

> This will produce a 'fat-jar' in the build folder under `build/libs`

## How to run
(assuming you have done a build)

```shell
java -jar ./build/libs/news-cli-all.jar
```
